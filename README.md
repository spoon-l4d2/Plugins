> This is a just small repo where I keep all of my plugins. Not all of my stuff is on here, but all the stuff that I felt like making public is :d

### `l4d2_melee_spawn_rules.smx`
Gives various control over the spawning of melees. Allows you to limit specified melees (or a group of melees) to a certain amount, allows you to remove melees all together, and allows you to force a certain amount of melees to spawn. View inside source-code for more detailed information.

### `l4d2_anti_smoketank.smx`
Gives smokers a full recharge ***(by default)*** if a Tank insta-clears their target. This is to prevent those annoying insta-pull punch combos. (Currently being refactored.)

### `l4d2_boomer_horde_control.smx`
Allows control over the amount of common being spawned per boomed survivor. See inside source for more information on usage.

### `l4d2_charger_getup_fix.smx`
Allows control over long charger get ups. It will add god frames and allows for config developers to enable/disable them, and replace all long get-ups with normal animations. View source for more info and cvars.

### `l4d2_sounds_blocker.smx`
Sounds Blocker is a plugin that allows you to block certain sounds from being played. It's very useful for blocking loud unnecessary sounds. It comes with some built in presets and also allows you to add custom sounds. If a sound is blocked in a preset and you don't want that one specific sound to be blocked, you can whitelist it! View comments in source-code for more information.

### `nogetupskip.smx`
Blocks players from being able to switch teams / spectate during a get up animation (also tank punch animation) causing the animation to be skipped.
