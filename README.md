# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
This is a small repo where I keep all of my plugins. Still pretty new to creating plugins so you can expect a few nooby errors in my code ðŸ˜„

### l4d2_sounds_blocker.smx
Sounds Blocker is a plugin that allows you to block certain sounds from being played. It's very useful for blocking loud unnecessary sounds. It comes with some built in presets and also allows you to add custom sounds. If a sound is blocked in a preset and you don't want that one specific sound to be blocked, you can whitelist it! View comments in source-code for more information.

### l4d2_witch_toggler.smx
The Witch Toggle plugin allows players to vote on whether or not they want the witch to spawn. Admins can force the toggle using `sm_forcewitch` or `!forcewitch`.

### readyup.smx
Custom version of readyup that allows more control over the footers. Creates new Natives that allow you to edit a footer.
